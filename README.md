# ScrollingGear
Shows a gear that turns when the user scrolls up or down.

This is a really simple example. Basically I liked the scrolling gear animation on the [urban code deploy website](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/products/urbancode-deploy/) and This is my attempt to duplicate that animation.I You can see it in action [here](http://srlee309.github.io/ScrollingGear/)
