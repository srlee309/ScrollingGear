# ScrollingGear
Shows a gear that turns when the user scrolls up or down.
This is a really simple example. You can see it in action [here](http://srlee309.github.io/ScrollingGear/)
I liked the scrolling gear animation on the [urban code deploy website](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/products/urbancode-deploy/). This is my attempt to duplicate that animation.
